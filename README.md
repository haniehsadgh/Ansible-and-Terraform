**after downloading the zip file:**
- run 'terraform init' to Prepare your working directory for other commands
- run 'terraform apply' to  Create infrastructure (this will take a few minutes)

When Apply complete, will output ec2 instances dns names and their ipv4 addresses
You should have hosts.yaml and ansible.config generated by terraform in the 4640-assignment-app-files directory located in same directory as main.tf.

- run cd '4640-assignment-app-files' where the application files and playbook are
- run 'ansible-playbook playbook.yaml' to  Run Ansible Playbook against the Infrastructure you just created

Once completed, access the  web server from any browser using the IP address provided in the outputs section of Terraform
